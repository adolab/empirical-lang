This directory contains the Vector Virtual Machine (VVM). This is a runtime designed for Empirical and may act as a mid-level IR in the future (whenever we create a JIT).

VVM has statically typed vector-aware opcodes. For example, `add_i64v_i64v` adds two 64-bit vectors together. Since there is no type look-up and only a single dispatch to reach the C++ function, execution is almost as fast as native code.

The virtual machine is pretty straightforward:

 - `bytecode.cpp`: handles encode/decode for bytecode
 - `interpret.cpp`: executes the bytecode
 - `assemble.cpp`: assembler using VVM's assembly language (`VVMAsm.g4`)

All of the above rely on `vvm.hpp` to define what the VM is capable of.

Any VVM header file that ends with `.h` is generated by either ANTLR or `gen_vvm.py` and will be found in `build/`.
